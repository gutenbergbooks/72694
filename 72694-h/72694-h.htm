<span class="fs80">THE GRAVE BY THE ROADSIDE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> history of Bethlehem is the romance
of Bethlehem; a story of love
and daring, of brave men and beautiful
women. We do not know that story in
great detail; but here and there across the
centuries, the light breaks on the little Judean
town and we catch a fleeting glimpse
of some scene of tender affection or chivalrous
adventure. And it is striking to notice
how many of these incidents involve
womanly devotion and self-sacrifice, both
before and after the Most Blessed of Women
suffered and rejoiced in Bethlehem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Long, long centuries before that first
Christmas was dreamed of, the story of
Bethlehem begins. And lo, the earliest episode
has to do with a birth day.</p>

<p>In the yellow evening light a little band
of nomadic shepherds is straggling along
the dusty road past the high, gray walls of
the outer fortifications of Jerusalem—not
Jerusalem the Holy City, but Jerusalem the
Jebusite stronghold, which is to remain
heathen and hateful for a thousand years
until, in that far-distant future, the arrogant
fortress shall fall before the onslaughts
of the mighty men of David.</p>

<p>At the head of the long line of herds and
pack-animals and armed retainers walks the
chief, Jacob ben-Isaac. A generation before,
he had passed along this same ancient
caravan route going northward; but no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
would recognize that frightened, homesick
fugitive in the grave, self-confident leader
who travels southward to-day. For now he
is Sheikh Jacob, full of years and riches and
wisdom; Jacob the strong man, the successful
man and, in his own rude way, the good
man.</p>

<p>An hour’s journey beyond Jerusalem
there appear shining on a hilltop to the left
the white stone houses of Bethlehem, at the
sight of which the tired herdsmen grow
more cheerful and the slow-moving caravan
quickens somewhat its pace; for close
under those protecting walls the tribe of
B’nai Jacob will shelter its flocks for the
night, safe alike from wolves and from
marauding Arab bands.</p>

<p>But just as they reach the spot where the
road to Bethlehem branches off to the left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
from the main caravan route, there is a sudden
change of plan. The hope of camping
at the town is abandoned, and one of the
low, black, goat-hair tents is hastily set up
right by the roadside. Then there is an excited
bustling among the household servants,
and a time of anxious waiting for
Sheikh Jacob, until Bilhah, the handmaid,
puts into the old man’s arms his son Benjamin,
his youngest boy, who is long to be the
comfort of the father’s declining years.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image031" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image031.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE TOMB OF RACHEL<br>
In the background the town of Beit Jala</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Soon, however, the cries of rejoicing are
hushed. From the women’s quarters comes
a loud, shrill wail of grief. And before the
B’nai Jacob break camp again the leader
raises a heap of stones over the grave of
Rachel—his Rachel—a gray-haired woman
now and bent with toil, but still to him the
beautiful girl whom he loved and for whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>he labored and sinned those twice seven
long years in the strength of his young manhood.</p>

<p>Many years afterward, when Benjamin
was a grown man and Jacob lay dying in the
distant land of Egypt, the thoughts of the
homesick old sheikh dwelt on the lonely
grave by the roadside.</p>

<p>“I buried her there on the way to Bethlehem,”
he said.</p>

<p>Her tombstone remains “unto this day,”
the Hebrew narrator adds. Indeed, even to
our own day, a spot by the Bethlehem road,
about a mile from the town, is pointed out
as the burial place of Rachel. Probably no
site in Palestine is attested by the witness of
so continuous a line of historians and travelers.
For many centuries the grave was
marked by a pyramid of stones. The present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
structure, with its white dome, is only
about four hundred years old. But there it
stands “unto this day,” revered by Christians,
Jews and Moslems, and the wandering
Arabs bring their dead to be buried in
its holy shadow.</p>

<p>Such is the first Biblical reference to
Bethlehem. A son was born there! More
significant still, there was a vicarious sacrifice—a
laying down of one life for another.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE GIRL FROM BEYOND JORDAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the Book of Judges are recounted the
adventures which befell certain Bethlehemites
in those lawless days when “there
was no king in Israel and every man did
that which was right in his own eyes.”
But the people mentioned in this history
were no longer dwelling in the city of their
birth; and we are glad of an excuse to pass
by the tale of reckless crime and merciless
vengeance. Yet here, too, if the story were
not too cruel to repeat, we should find a
woman dying for one whom she loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>Even in that rough frontier period, however,
there were interludes of peace and
kindliness; and like the cooling breeze which
blows from snow-capped Lebanon upon the
burning brow of the Syrian reaper, is the
sense of grateful refreshment when we turn
from the heartrending monotony of scenes
of cruelty and lust and treachery to the
sweet, clean air of the whitening harvest
fields of Boaz of Bethlehem.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the two strange women entered the
square there was great excitement among
the chattering busy-bodies who were waiting
their turn to fill their earthen jars at the
public well; for one of the travelers was seen
to be no other than old Naomi, who long
years before had gone away across Jordan
with her husband Elimelech to better their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
fortunes among the famous farm-lands of
Moab. Now the wanderer has returned to
the old home, poor and widowed and childless—no
doubt to the secret gratification of
the more cautious stay-at-homes, who had
never dared tempt fortune by such an emigration
to distant Moab, and who were still
no richer and no poorer than their fathers’
fathers had been.</p>

<p>The other woman was younger, a foreigner,
a widow, so the gossip ran, who had
married Naomi’s dead son. The women at
the well smiled at her quaint accent, for the
dialect of Moab is quite different from that
of the Bethlehem district. But many a
stalwart young farmer dreamed that night
of the lonely, appealing eyes of the stranger
from beyond Jordan.</p>

<p>Even middle-aged Boaz is stirred when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the next morning he finds the slender Moabitess
among the women who are gleaning
in his barley field; for romance is not always
dead in the soul of a mature and wealthy
landowner. Boaz, for all his grizzling hair,
is a hero who makes us feel very warm
and comfortable about the heart. He is
so generous, so thoughtful, so humble in
his final happiness. He has already been
touched by the story of the faithfulness of
the young widow who said to her mother-in-law,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from
following after thee; for whither thou goest, I
will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy
people shall be my people, and thy God my God.”</p>
</div>

<p>So the rich man drops a hint to his servants
to let fall carelessly little heaps of
grain where the new gleaner can easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
gather them. He remembers the rough,
dissolute character of the itinerant harvesters,
and warns them to treat the young
woman with respect and courtesy. At noontime
he invites her to share the simple
luncheon provided for the farm-hands. A
few weeks later the lonely rich man discovers
her affection for him, and our hearts
beat in sympathy with his as, with characteristic
modesty, he exclaims,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Blessed be thou of Jehovah, my daughter:
thou hast shown more kindness in the latter end
than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedest
not young men, whether poor or rich.”</p>
</div>

<p>But as well might one attempt to retouch
the soft colorings of the Judean sunrise as
to re-tell the beautiful idyll of Ruth. Old
Josephus quite misses the delicate beauty of
the story; for he concludes his smug paraphrase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
by saying, “I was therefore obliged
to recount this history of Ruth, because I
had a mind to demonstrate the power of God,
who, without difficulty, can raise those that
are of ordinary parents to dignity and
splendor.”</p>

<p>They lived together happily ever afterward.
Even sad Naomi found a new interest
in life when she took into her lonely
old arms the form of little Obed. For this
bit of Bethlehem history, like the first, and
like the greatest later on, ends with the coming
of a baby boy. And doubtless, if the
whole of the tale were told us, we should
some day see grandmother Ruth crooning
over Obed’s son Jesse, who was to be the
father of a king.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE BOY WHO WAS TO BE KING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">An</span> ancient Hebrew commentary on First
Samuel says that Jesse became “a
weaver of veils for the sanctuary.” This
may be why the story of David and Goliath
compares the giant’s staff to “a weaver’s
beam.” Whatever his occupation, the
grandson of rich Boaz must have been a
man of some means, and influential in Bethlehem
society. Also he had seven fine,
stalwart sons. Indeed, he had eight sons;
but, as we all know, the youngest was out
tending the sheep when Samuel came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>The rough and ready era of the Judges,
when every man did that which was right
in his own eyes, was now gone forever.
Israel had a king; and a tall, handsome figure
of a man King Saul was. And for a while
he was a king who defeated foreign invaders
on every side. But Saul’s character could
not stand the test of the sudden elevation
to a position of power and responsibility.
His strength lay in brilliant, spectacular efforts,
rather than in a patient, well-organized
rule. Quarrels arose between the jealous
tribes of Israel. Conquered foes prepared
new and better equipped forays against the
poorly protected frontier of the new kingdom.
Worst of all, Saul broke with his
tried advisers and became prey to an irrational,
suspicious melancholy, which prevented
him from coping with dangers which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
a few years earlier would only have aroused
his ambitious energy.</p>

<p>Saul had failed; so Samuel, the veteran
prophet, judge and king-maker, went quietly
to Bethlehem to select a new leader who
should direct the troublous destinies of Israel.</p>

<p>It was doubtless the same farm where the
young stranger from beyond Jordan had
gleaned the sheaves of barley almost a century
before. How proud Naomi would have
been if she could have lived to see those tall
great-grandchildren of Ruth and Boaz!
How excited we boys used to get as we saw
the seven sons of Jesse standing there in a
row, and waited for old Samuel to tell us
which one was to be the king! Surely it
must be the eldest, Eliab, who is so tall and
handsome, the very image of what Saul was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
in his youth. No, it is not Eliab, perhaps
just because he is too much like King Saul.
Abinadab is rejected and Shammah, too; and
the prophet’s eye passes even more rapidly
over Nethaneel and Raddai and Ozem.</p>

<p>Then Samuel turns to the father with a
perplexed frown.</p>

<p>“Are these all your sons?”</p>

<p>“Yes—that is, all that are grown up.
David is only a boy. He is taking care of
the sheep this morning.”</p>

<p>“Call him, too,” commands Samuel. “Let
Abinadab mind the sheep for a while.”</p>

<p>So in a few minutes David is brought in.
He is fair in complexion, like so many Judean
Jews to-day, but his skin is burnt to a deep
tan by the sun of the sheep pasture. His eye
has a captivating twinkle, and he can hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
keep from humming a tune even in the presence
of the prophet.</p>

<p>We guessed it all the while! This is indeed
a royal fellow; and the old prophet
touches the thick brown hair of the shepherd
lad with a strange, loving reverence as he
tells him that some day he must be his people’s
king.</p>

<p>This time I think that Josephus is probably
right. For he tells us that while they were
all sitting at dinner afterward, Samuel
whispered in the boy’s ear “that God chose
him to be their king: and exhorted him to be
righteous, and obedient to His commands,
for that by this means his kingdom would
continue for a long time, and that his house
should be of great splendor and celebrated in
the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Surely wise old Samuel must have given
the boy some such advice as that.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE ADVENTURE OF THE WELL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was a long while, however, before David
really became a king. As his frame grew
into a sturdy manhood, he fought with lions
and bears and Philistine champions. His
sweet singing brought him to the notice of
Saul and he became the king’s favorite musician,
until the jealousy of the half-crazed
monarch drove the young man into exile.
Then for years the former shepherd lived a
wild, half-brigand life among the caves of
the rugged steppe-land south of Bethlehem,
gradually gathering around him a company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
of intrepid outlaws, administering rough
justice over a number of villages which
put themselves under his protection, making
sudden forays into the Philistine country
just to the west, and again so hotly pursued
by the soldiers of the relentless Saul that he
was forced to seek an asylum among the
enemies of Israel, who were always glad to
forget old scores and welcome this dauntless
free-lance and his redoubtable band of warriors.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It may have been during this outlaw period,
or it may have been shortly after
David’s accession to the throne, when his
kingdom was still disorganized, and an easy
prey to foreign invaders. At any rate,
David and his band were hiding in the cave
of Adullam, a few miles from Bethlehem.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
The little company was for the moment safe,
but the country all around was overrun by
foreign troops, and even Bethlehem, the
scene of so many happy boyhood memories,
was occupied by a Philistine garrison.</p>

<p>No wonder that David felt very weary and
discouraged as he thought of the old home
town in the hands of heathen soldiers. No
wonder that he sometimes became irritable
and petulant, and wished for things that he
could not have. There was a spring right
by the cave of Adullam. The inhabitants of
Palestine, however, can distinguish between
water drawn from different sources, in a
manner which seems marvelous to our duller
taste. Yet we need not believe that the
water in the City of David was any better
than that of the cave of Adullam in order to
sympathize with the tired, homesick cry—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, that one would give me water to drink
of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the
gate!”</p>

<p>Then there was a little stir among David’s
bodyguard. One soldier whispered to another,
who nudged a third; and soon three
dark forms slipped quietly away from the
circle of lights around the campfire. For
those rough outlaws idolized their fair-haired
young leader, and they had been
worried and grieved by his recent fit of
melancholy.</p>

<p>At midnight there was a sudden rattling
of the well-chain in the square by the Bethlehem
gate—then a challenge from the
startled Philistine sentry—a rush of soldiers
along the stony street. But the three seasoned
warriors slipped easily through the
camp of the half-awakened army. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
turned and doubled through the familiar
maze of narrow, winding streets until they
came to the steep terraces at the south of the
town, where they dropped out of sight among
the perplexing shadows of the olive orchards,
through which they made their way swiftly
back to the wild steppe-land and the mountain
fastness where the band kept watch over
their sleeping chief.</p>

<p>Mighty men they were, these three, and it
is no wonder that their exploit became one of
the favorite tales of Hebrew history. But
when they offered David the water for which
he had longed, there came a lump into his
throat and he said, “I can’t take it. My
thoughtless wish might have cost too much.
It would be like drinking my brave men’s
blood, to drink that for which they have endangered
their lives. It is too precious to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
drink. I will pour it out on the ground—so—as
an offering to Jehovah.”</p>

<p>Surely the God of Battles esteemed that
simple libation as holy a thing as holocausts
of bullocks and rams, and forgave many of
the sins of those rough, hard outlaws because
of the loving devotion they showed toward
one whom He had chosen to be the deliverer
of Israel.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An old legend says that after the mystic
Star had guided the Wise Men to the Saviour’s
cradle, it fell from heaven and
quenched its divine fire in “David’s Well.”
And surely, if the Star had fallen, it could
have found no more fitting resting place than
the Well by the Gate, whose water had been
won by such unselfish adventure and dedicated
with such tender gratitude.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE NIGHT OF NIGHTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the short twilight of the winter evening
a husband and wife are trudging
wearily along the road which winds past
the high gray walls of Jerusalem—no longer
Jerusalem the proud capital of the dynasty
of David, but a mere provincial town of the
mighty Roman Empire, whose streets are
dizzy with the shouting of a dozen languages
and thronged with crowds of
Greeks, Romans, Persians, Armenians, Ethiopians,
and travelers from even more distant
lands, who rub shoulders carelessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
with the fanatical Pharisees and intriguing
Sadducees whose mutual bickerings make
them a laughing-stock to their Gentile masters;
while there sits upon the throne of
David a half-breed underling Edomite,
through whose diseased veins flow the cruelty
and lust and cowardice and treachery of
turgid streams of unspeakable ancestry—Herod,
called in grim jest, “the Great.”</p>

<p>December in Judea is a cold, dreary month,
with penetrating storms of rain and sleet.
It may even snow; and sometimes the drifts
lie knee-deep on that highroad from Jerusalem
to Bethlehem. So they hasten their
steps, these footsore travelers who have
come all the way from distant Galilee at the
command of their Roman rulers; for darkness
is coming on, and this night, of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
nights, they must find a safe, warm resting-place.</p>

<p>But when Bethlehem is at last reached,
their cheerful anticipation changes to utter,
weary dejection; for the village inn proves
to be already overcrowded with other Bethlehemites
who have returned to their birthplace
to be registered there for the census.</p>

<p>Only in the stable is there room; and this
is a low, dark place, half building, half cave.
In front, it is walled up with rough stones;
but at the rear it extends far into what
seems to have been originally a natural opening
in the hillside. Around three sides of
the stable runs a low, level shelf, with an
iron ring every few feet, to which the beasts
are tied as they eat the fodder spread before
them on the stone ledge. This manger is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
not an uncomfortable resting place for the
hardy muleteers, who often sleep there on
the straw. But it makes a hard bed for
Joseph—and for Mary.</p>

<p>The sky has cleared now, and through the
open door can be seen a square of twinkling
stars, one of which shines with unusual brilliancy.
Within, however, it is very dark;
for the lantern of the night-watchman shines
only a little way through the sombre shadows
of the stable. The cattle and horses
have finished munching the grain. The last
uneasy lowing ceases. It is very still, except
in one far corner where the strangers
cannot sleep.</p>

<p>And then there is a baby’s cry. And the
bright star shines with glorious radiance
over David’s City. And upon the drowsy
shepherds in the fields where the Moabitess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
gleaned, there bursts a wondrous light and
the sound of heavenly singing.</p>

<p>For the fullness of time has come. Upon
the humble Judean town has burst that
glory sung by the prophets of old. The long
line of Rachel and Ruth and royal David has
at last issued in the King of kings.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">But</span> even at that first Christmastide,
Bethlehem must again be the scene of
innocent suffering in another’s place, as for
the Christ-child’s sake some twenty baby
boys in the little town are put to death by
order of King Herod, whose diseased, suspicious
mind trembles at the thought of even
an infant claimant for his throne.</p>

<p>Five hundred years before, when the
strong young men of Bethlehem had been
sent away into Babylonian exile, the loud
wailing from bereaved, heart-broken homes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
had recalled to Jeremiah that other sad
mother buried there by the lonely roadside.
So now again, the awful outrage, perpetrated
almost within sight of that venerable tomb,
seems to be linked across the long centuries
with the first Bethlehem grief; and once
more, in the words of the Lamenting
Prophet, there is</p>

<p>The Blossoms of Martyrdom—so a fourth

who “have come out of great tribulation”
there must surely stand in the foremost rank
the little band of Bethlehem children whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>

<span class="fs80">THE STORY OF THE STABLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Between</span> the years 1480 and 1483,
Brother Felix Fabri, a learned German
monk of Ulm, made two voyages to Palestine,
during the course of which he collected information
of all sorts about the holy places,
which he later published in a large and important
book. Some of his statements about
Bethlehem are very accurate. Others do not
strike us as quite so convincing.</p>

<p>According to these stories told by Brother
Felix, Boaz inherited from his father Salmon,
who had married Rahab of Jericho, a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
mansion built at the very edge of Bethlehem,
so that part of the house projected outside
the town wall. In the rock underneath the
main building was a natural grotto which
was used as a cellar, and also as a dwelling
room during the hot months. The house
passed in due time into the possession of
Boaz’ grandson Jesse, whose son David was
born in the lower room. After David became
king, however, the family removed to
Jerusalem, the deserted homestead gradually
came into a state of disrepair, and finally
the part in the rock was used as a public
stable. This degradation of the once splendid
mansion was permitted by Providence,
so that at last the great Son of David might
be born amid humble surroundings, and yet
in the very place where His famous ancestor
first saw the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>After our Lord’s Ascension, His mother
lived for fourteen years, dwelling in Jerusalem,
whence every month she and her
friends made a pious pilgrimage to Bethlehem,
that they might worship at the cave
of the Saviour’s birth. This so enraged
the Jews that finally they defiled the stable
and blocked up its entrance with stones.</p>

<p>Following the destruction of Jerusalem by
Titus, in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 70, Christians were again allowed
to dwell in the Holy Land and to
visit the place of the Nativity, which they
cleansed from the Jewish defilement and
hallowed by their worship. But in the year
132, the Emperor Hadrian laid waste the
city of Bethlehem, placed in the sacred cave
a statue of Jupiter and, as a crowning insult,
instituted in the very Grotto of the Nativity
the iniquitous rites of the Adonis cult, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
continued to be celebrated there for almost
two hundred years.</p>

<p>This, however, was the last heathen desecration
of the holy spot. In the year 326
the pious Helena, mother of the Christian
emperor, Constantine, “cleansed the place of
the sweet Nativity of our Lord, cast out
the abominations of the idols from the holy
cave, overthrew all that she found there, and
beneath the ruins found the Lord’s manger
entire.” In the manger she discovered the
stone on which the Blessed Virgin had
placed the Babe’s head, and the hay and the
swaddling clothes and Joseph’s sandals and
the long, loose gown which Mary wore.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>These were all carried to the capital, Constantinople,
and remained five hundred years
in the Cathedral of St. Sophia, until Charlemagne,
returning from the conquest of Jerusalem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>(so says Fabri), begged the relics as
the reward of his holy labors and took them
with him to the West. The hay was bestowed
in the church of Sta. Maria Maggiore
in Rome, the manger in St. John Lateran,
and the garments in the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>After St. Helena had purified the place of
the Nativity, she erected above it a church
of wondrous beauty, but in such a manner
that the rock beneath and the cave in which
the Saviour was born should remain untouched.
Whereupon the Jews of Bethlehem
in derision nicknamed the saintly empress
“the Woman of the Stable.”</p>

<p>But by the time we reach St. Helena and
the building of the Bethlehem church, legend
is beginning to merge into history.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE EPITAPH OF THE LADY PAULA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> church at Bethlehem is crowded to
the doors with a reverent assemblage,
which overflows into the public square and
fills all the nearby streets with silent, sad-faced
worshippers. It is four hundred and
four years since the blessed Nativity of our
Lord, and the slow, solemn music which
sounds faintly from within the heavy walls
of the ancient church is the requiem of the
noblest, sweetest, saddest lady who ever
made her home in Bethlehem for Christ’s
sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>The funeral procession had seemed like a
triumphal march. The bier was borne upon
the shoulders of bishops, whilst other bishops
carried candles beside it and led the
antiphonal singing of the choirs. Beside
these dignitaries walked the sweet-faced
sisters from the great convent which the
dead woman had founded, and barefooted
brothers from the no less famous monastery
which she had endowed. Strange figures
followed in the procession: wild, shaggy
hermits who for the first time in years had
come out of their caves in the wilderness of
Judea, and nuns bound to perpetual self-immolation,
whose unnatural pallor told of incessant
vigils broken this once only, that they
also might have a part in the final honors
shown to their beloved and godly benefactor.
Aged Jerome was there; the foremost scholar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
in all Christendom, but now bent and weary
with the realization that world-wide fame is
but a paltry substitute for the companionship
of a faithful friend. Beside him walked
the proud bishop John of Jerusalem, not long
since the enemy of Paula and Jerome and at
bitter strife with the convent of Bethlehem;
but now, it seems, a sincere mourner of one
before whose pure and devoted spirit even
mighty hierarchs must bow in humble reverence.</p>

<p>But those whose hearts grieve most sincerely
cannot all gain admission to the
church. The square before the entrance
is crowded with the poor and the sick and
the outcast who are waiting patiently until
the long ceremony shall end. Then these
humble folk will slip into the quiet church
at eventide and pray beside the coffin of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
beloved friend, while unrestrained tears roll
down their haggard faces—tears for her, and
them, and Bethlehem.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It hardly seems seventeen years since the
coming of the Lady Paula stirred the quiet
life of Bethlehem. All the world knew of
the young Roman widow, of noble family and
enormous wealth, who had renounced the
luxurious life to which she had been accustomed
and had aroused the gossip of the
capital by her coarse dress and incessant devotions
and the menial duties which she performed
in her efforts to relieve the condition
of the crowded slums of the city. And then
the wealthy lady had broken the last ties of
her old life, so the rumor ran, and had left
Rome forever in order to dwell in holy Bethlehem
with her daughter and their friend and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
teacher, the reverend presbyter Jerome.</p>

<p>For a time Paula and her daughter lived
quietly in a small rented house, until the
completion of a convent which was erected
at her expense. A monastery was next
built, of which Jerome was made the head,
and in connection with this, a hospice for the
entertainment of the strangers who in greater
and greater numbers came hither to visit the
holy places and to study under the famous
teacher.</p>

<p>Thereafter Paula was the very spring of
Bethlehem life and Christian activity. She
managed the affairs of her various establishments
with patience, tact, and great executive
ability; and yet found time to perfect
her Greek and to learn Hebrew, so that under
the guidance of Jerome she might read the
entire Bible in the original tongues. Pilgrims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
from far and near taxed the resources
of the famous hospice, and gifts to innumerable
charities at last exhausted even the large
fortune she had inherited, so that she became
not only poor, but in debt. And reading
between the lines of his own correspondence,
we can see that not least among the
godly woman’s worries was the care of the
great, but somewhat crabbed old man whom
later centuries were to honor as “Saint”
Jerome. It would hardly be an exaggeration
to say that Christendom is indebted to
a woman for its most important and influential
version of the Bible; for it is easy to conceive
that the Vulgate translation might
never have been completed by Jerome, without
the constant aid and encouragement
which were so freely bestowed on the aged
author by his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>All these varied and exacting tasks were
undertaken by one who never enjoyed robust
health. Paula was often prostrated by serious
illness and she further overtaxed her
strength by incessant fasts and mortifications,
until at last the life of the eager, self-sacrificing,
loving, faithful woman burnt itself
out at the age of fifty-six.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The funeral service is over now. The
long procession has left the church, and for
three days the poor whom Paula loved can
worship at her bier. Then the tender,
weary, faithful heart will be laid at rest in a
vault beneath the church, “close to the cave
of the Lord,” and above her cavern sepulchre
lonely old Jerome will inscribe these lines:</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SCHOLAR IN THE CAVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> of the caves beneath the church at
Bethlehem has a window; but the small
opening is so high up in the wall that very
little light enters, and it is some time before
the outlines of the room can be clearly distinguished.
It is a square cell, about twelve
feet across. The window is on the north
side. At the west a narrow stairway goes
up to the monastery. At the south a door
leads through a series of other caves to the
Grotto of the Nativity. On the eastern wall
hangs a crucifix. In the center of the cell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
is a roughly-made desk, cluttered with books
and papers, while other heavy volumes and
thick rolls of manuscript are piled here and
there upon the floor.</p>

<p>In front of the desk sits an old, old man,
whose lean, emaciated form is clothed in a
long, brown robe which, though of very
rough material, is neat and clean. His hair
is sparse and gray, and his flowing beard is
white as snow. His face is thin and pale,
seamed by deep wrinkles worn by physical
suffering and spiritual anguish; but about
the mouth are other lines which tell of a
stern, unconquerable spirit. The eyes are
kind, but very weary, and reddened by much
study, and he rests them now upon his long,
thin fingers as he ceases his work for a moment
and listens reverently to the muffled
music of the service in the church above.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>It is sixteen years since Paula died. The
old man is the presbyter Eusebius Sophronius
Hieronymus, better known as St. Jerome;
the most famous scholar of his age and by
far the greatest man whose name has been
associated with Bethlehem during all the
Christian era. His little cavern cell is the
literary center of the world.</p>

<p>For more than a generation Jerome has
pursued his scriptural studies here, under
the ever-present inspiration of the holy associations
which cluster so closely about the
cave. Here he has often spent long night
hours in gaining that perfect mastery of
Hebrew and Aramaic and Greek which enables
him to grasp the most subtle meanings
of the sacred writings. Here his pen has
moved with such feverish activity that more
than once he has completed the translation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
of an entire Book in a single day. At this
rude desk have been written words that
shook Europe; for Jerome has been the
friend of popes and the adviser of councils.
From this humble cell have gone forth
learned commentaries, controversial articles,
translations of the Greek Fathers, a voluminous
and widely-circulated correspondence,
and that which future generations will value
most highly of all, the splendid revision of
the entire Latin Bible—the Vulgate. This
tremendous literary activity has won for its
author the reputation of being the foremost
writer of the age, and has made Bethlehem
the goal of innumerable pilgrimages by admiring
students.</p>

<p>The death of Paula, however, seemed to
mark the turning point in Jerome’s career.
During the long, lonely years since then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
has never enjoyed the same scholarly quiet,
and he has had to cope with repeated and
varied misfortunes. The very winter she
died was one of unusual severity, which
sorely tried his physical powers, already
weakened by disease and by long-continued
privations. The Isaurians came down from
Asia Minor and devasted northern Palestine,
so that the monastery was overcrowded with
fugitives; and with Paula gone, the supervision
of the various religious establishments
in Bethlehem was thrust more and more
upon Jerome, who we may believe was not
especially gifted as an executive. Heartrending
tidings came from Italy, telling of
Barbarian invasions which at last culminated
in the sack of Rome by Alaric. Jerome
became involved in bitter theological controversies,
which resulted in an estrangement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
from some of his oldest friends and
once at least endangered his life, when a mob
of angry partisans set the monastery on fire,
killed one of the inmates, and forced the
aged scholar to flee for refuge to a neighboring
fortress. Recently the care of the
monastery and hospice has occupied all the
day, and although he has tried to work on
his commentaries at night, his failing eyesight
has finally become so weak that he can
hardly decipher the Hebrew letters by candle-light.</p>

<p>Jerome’s spirit, however, is unbroken by
defeat. His last works may show something
of the irritability of illness and age, but
there is never any thought of relaxation or
compromise, or any weakening of faith.
And perhaps the great man never seems
greater then when we see him at the age of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
eighty, sitting here in his cavern cell, so sick
and lonely and indomitable. His translation
of Scripture is not yet accepted as the Bible
of all Western Christendom, his sainthood
is as yet undreamed of, his dearest friends
are dead or alienated, the dread advance of
the Barbarian hordes is threatening the very
existence of civilized Europe, and the brilliant
era of ecclesiastical literature of which
he has been the brightest light is already fading
into a dull, spiritless gloom.</p>

<p>The evening shadows deepen upon the little
cave at Bethlehem, as upon the vast, dying
Roman Empire. The chanting of the priests
in the church above ceases. The familiar
square characters of the dearly-loved Hebrew
manuscript grow faint and blurred before
the scholar’s eyes. He puts away his
pen with a sigh. No disciple takes it up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
“There is no continuation of his work; a few
more letters of Augustine and Polinus, and
night falls over the West.”</p>

<p>So they bury him there in the cave, close
to faithful Paula, close to the birthplace of
his Lord.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE CHRISTMAS CORONATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the year of our Lord 1101, on the very
birthday of the Saviour and at the birthplace
of the King of kings, Bethlehem is to
witness the most gorgeous, striking scene in
all its varied and dramatic history; for the
long, cruel centuries of Moslem domination
are over at last, the banners of the victorious
Crusaders now float proudly above the
ramparts of Jerusalem, and the mighty Baldwin,
Count of Flanders by inheritance and
Prince of Edessa by right of conquest, is to
be crowned this Christmas Day the first
Christian king of Palestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Two years earlier, when the Saracens
heard that the Western armies were approaching,
they destroyed the Christian
quarter of Bethlehem, leaving standing only
the Church of the Nativity; but the gallant
Tancred came promptly to the rescue
of the frightened, homeless citizens with
a hundred picked knights, and, as a reward
of their valor, it was this little band who,
looking northward from a hill near Bethlehem,
were the first of all the Crusaders
to gain the longed-for view of the Holy
City.</p>

<p>As soon as Jerusalem was taken and the
Moslem army put to rout, the Crusaders set
to work to rebuild the nearby City of the
Nativity, and now that a ruler has been
chosen for the new Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem,
the coronation ceremony is to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
place at Bethlehem; for Baldwin, with a
modesty not entirely in harmony with his
previous ambitious and selfish career, has
refused to be crowned in the Holy City
where great David had his throne. Doubtless
also the shrewd Count of Flanders is
not blind to the dramatic possibilities of a
Christmas coronation in the Christmas
City.</p>

<p>So to-day the plain, sombre interior of the
Church of the Nativity is all ablaze with
brilliant coloring. Along the walls of the
nave are battle-worn standards, blessed by
pious bishops in distant counties by the
Rhine and the Rhone and the Northern
Ocean, and sanctified since by many a gallant
exploit before the walls of Nicea and
Antioch, so that their escutcheons now bear
crimson quarterings which were not embroidered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
there by the lovely ladies in the
lonely palaces across the sea.</p>

<p>At the rear of the church are ranks of
sunburnt men-at-arms in battered chain-armor,
whose stern, self-possessed demeanor
throws into greater contrast the nervous,
curious excitement of the Bethlehemite
Christians, who have put on their brightest
tunics in honor of their valiant deliverers
from thraldom to the Saracens. The transepts
are crowded with bishops and the
great feudal lords who have thrown in
their lot with the new kingdom, for the sake
of the rich fiefs which are at Baldwin’s disposal.
The garments of the nobles glisten
with jewels, and the dignitaries of the
church are resplendent with gold and laces.
Here and there upon the gorgeous scene
the high windows of the church cast narrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
slanting beams, and the tinted lamps
shed their soft glow upon the mass of
variegated, orient hues, which are yet held
in one color harmony by the insistent repetition
of the crimson crosses which shine on
every breast.</p>

<p>Where the lamps are most numerous and
the light from the windows of the transepts
shines brightest, Baldwin of Flanders kneels
before the great altar and bows his proud
head in a semblance of humility as the jeweled
crown is placed upon his brow by the noble
Daimbert, archbishop of Pisa, patriarch
of Jerusalem and temporal lord of many a
broad fief and populous village in Judea.</p>

<p>Surely now the veteran warriors chant
again that martial Psalm with which they
have advanced so often to the assault of infidel
strongholds, “Let God arise, let His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
enemies be scattered.” And the loud battle-cry
of the Crusade, which has echoed
above many a desperate conflict, now rolls
back and forth from wall to wall of the
ancient church with deafening reverberations,
“God wills it! God wills it!” And
this Christmas Day the glad music of the
<em>Gloria in Excelsis</em> rings with a new note of
triumph. For the Holy Land is at last reconquered.
The Sepulchre and the Manger
are cleansed. A Christian king is to reign
in millennial peace and prosperity over the
sacred hills of Palestine.</p>

<p>During the century following the successful
issue of the First Crusade, Bethlehem
took a leading part among the cities of the
Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1110 it
was elevated to the rank of an episcopal
see, whose fiefs included large tracts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
land scattered all through Palestine. The
Church of the Nativity, which the Crusaders
found to be somewhat bare and
dilapidated, was thoroughly restored and
adorned by rich gifts. The Byzantine
emperor, Manuel Comnenos, had the walls
beautified with magnificent mosaic pictures,
made of colored glass cubes set in a
background of gold. Among the other
mosaic saints, the artist Edfrem was allowed
to introduce the portrait of the generous
emperor. More modest donors presented
the church with a baptismal font
which bore the simple inscription that it was
given by “those whose names are known to
the Lord.”</p>

<p>Now that Palestine was no longer under
Moslem rule, pilgrims thronged from every
Christian country to visit the holy places,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
and Bethlehem was crowded with even
greater multitudes than during the days
of St. Helena or St. Jerome. At Christmas
time the vast concourse of clergy and
nobles and pilgrims celebrated the festival
with gorgeous pomp in the restored and now
magnificent church. There were peals of
ringing bells, and triumphant choruses of
praise, and swinging of priceless censers,
and above the great throng of worshippers
a golden star was pulled across the church,
while young men on the roof chanted the
song of the angels.</p>

<p>“In those days,” Brother Felix tells us,
“Bethlehem was full of people, famous and
rich. Christians of every country on
earth brought presents thither, and exceeding
rich merchants dwelt there.”</p>

<p>But with peace and wealth, the Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
population of Bethlehem became more and
more enervated and corrupt, until it is said
that at last one of the leading men of the
town planned to commit a deadly sin within
the very precincts of the sacred Cave of the
Nativity. When this was reported to the
Moslems, they saw that virtue had departed
from their Christian rulers, so they
were not afraid to rise up against them, and
soon they drove them out of all Palestine.</p>

<p>This is only a tradition; but it sounds almost
like an allegory of the actual issue of
the Crusades and the lamentable fate of the
short-lived Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.</p>

<span class="fs80">SOME BETHLEHEM LEGENDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Numberless</span> traditions have sprung
up concerning the sacred places in
and about Bethlehem and the holy persons
who dwelt there. Many of these tales are
really beautiful, and even when they will
not bear a too critical inspection, there is
often a moral overlaid by the extravagant
details of the narrative.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The story of the First Roses is told in
the words of Sir John Mandeville, who
heard it in Bethlehem in the year 1322, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
that the spelling of the old knight has
necessarily been modernized.</p>

<p>“And between the City and the Church
is the Felde Floridus, that is to say, the
Flowery Field: forasmuch as a fair Maiden
was blamed with wrong and slandered; for
which cause she was doomed to the Death;
and to be burnt in that place, to the which
she was led. And as the Fire began to burn
about her, she made her prayers to our Lord,
that as truly she was not guilty of that
Sin, He would help her and make it
known to all men, of His merciful Grace.
And when she had thus said, she entered
into the Fire, and anon was the Fire
quenched and out: and the Brands that
were burning, became red Roseries; and the
Brands that were not kindled, became white
Roseries, full of Roses. And these were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
the first Roseries and Roses, both white and
red, that ever any Man saw. And thus was
this Maiden saved by the Grace of God.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The chapter of the Koran entitled “Mary”
tells how a palm tree near the birthplace of
Jesus miraculously let fall its ripe dates in
order to satisfy His mother’s hunger.
Practically all early Moslem visitors to
Palestine speak of seeing this tree and note
the fact of its being the only one of the kind
growing in the district. This made the
miracle even more marvellous, as date-palms
have to be artificially cross-fertilized before
their fruit will come to maturity.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A twelfth century pilgrim tells us that
“every year in the middle of the night, at
the hour when Christ was born, all the trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
about the city of Bethlehem bow their
branches down to the ground toward the
place where Christ was born, and when the
sun rises, gradually raise them up again.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>About a mile outside of Bethlehem is still
pointed out the “Field of Peas,” but the
story of the origin of these small, round
stones has undergone a number of variations.
This is the way it was told to Henry
Maundrell, who visited Palestine about the
year 1700.</p>
<br>

<p>“Near this Monument (Rachel’s Tomb)
is a little piece of ground in which are picked
up a little sort of small round Stones, exactly
resembling Pease: Concerning which
they have a tradition here, that they were
once truly what they now seem to be; but
the Blessed Virgin petrify’d them by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>Miracle, in punishment to a surly Rustick,
who deny’d her the Charity of a handful of
them to relieve her hunger.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>According to a mediæval biography, St.
Jerome was one day studying in his cell at
Bethlehem, when there entered an enormous
lion, limping from an injured paw. The
tender-hearted saint bound up the wound,
which speedily healed, whereupon the great
beast was overwhelmed with gratitude and
attached himself permanently to his deliverer.</p>

<p>The lion followed Jerome about everywhere
like a dog, and slept at the feet of the
holy man while he was pursuing his Scriptural
studies. Upon occasion, however, the
complacent creature was not above minding
the monastery donkey when it was put out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
to pasture, or even acting as a beast of
burden; while at night the fearful roar of the
saint’s protector brought terror to the hearts
of any evil-doers who might be prowling
near the monastery grounds.</p>

<p>The story was accepted without question
during the Middle Ages, and many a valiant
Crusader was willing to make oath that he
had seen the ghosts of the saint and his attendant
lion strolling silently among the hilltops
of Judea in the midnight shadows.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A whole group of legends tell of the miraculous
deliverances of the Church of the
Nativity from destruction by the Moslems.</p>

<p>At one time the Sultan gave orders to dismantle
the interior, and carry off the precious
marble slabs from the floor and walls
of the church. But when the workmen prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
to tear away the wall near the stairways
which go down to the sacred cave,
suddenly there came out of the solid stone
a serpent of enormous size, who struck at
the piece of marble before which the Moslems
were standing. And lo, the rock
split under the force of his fiery tongue!
Swiftly the reptile glided to the next slab,
which he likewise cracked; and so he
passed through the church, splitting in all
no less than forty pieces of marble, after
which he disappeared as mysteriously as he
had come. The Sultan and his helpers were
stricken with terror at the apparition,
and gave up their purpose to deface the
church.</p>

<p>The cracks in the marble apparently disappeared
as soon as the danger was past;
but in substantiation of the truth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
story, mediæval pilgrims were shown traces
of the serpent’s path, which appeared as
though the stones had been marked by an
intense flame.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Jaffa Gate of Jerusalem opens out
upon two historic highways. The one
which gives its name to the gate leads westward
to the sea; the other, which we are to
take, passes southward along the Valley of
Hinnom between the Sultan’s Pool and the
western wall of the city, and then climbs
over the brow of a steep hill on its way to
Hebron, beyond which the caravan trail
leads farther on to the South Country and
the desert and the land of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>A good walker could go from Jerusalem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
to Bethlehem in a little more than an hour,
for the distance is hardly five miles; but it
will be more pleasant to stroll along leisurely,
studying the other wayfarers, and
stopping now and then to admire some rugged
old olive tree or to watch the changing
colors on the distant hills.</p>

<br>

<p>As soon as we are fairly started down the
Hebron road, we begin to pass little companies
of men and women who are coming
up from Bethlehem to the Holy City with
their merchandise. There is a striking difference
between the appearance of these
people and that of the other inhabitants of
Judea; a difference not only in dress, but
in feature. The men wear large yellow
turbans, and have full lips, long noses,
and high, sloping foreheads, so that they fit
in very closely with our common idea of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>the Hebrew type. They are not Jews, however,
but Christians, and it is said that in
the veins of many of them flows the blood of
the Crusaders. The boys we meet are
frank and independent, tramping merrily
along, with little caps on their heads, their
one long, loose garment tucked up into the
leather belt, and their brown, bare legs ending
in tremendous slippers which flop
clumsily with every step.</p>

<p>The women of Bethlehem are known
throughout Palestine for their peculiar headdress.
Over a high cap is thrown a large
white kerchief or veil, which falls behind
the shoulders and often reaches below the
waist. Seen from behind, the Bethlehemite
woman is a square of blue skirt, topped
by a tall triangle of white; from the front
she looks like a nun of some unfamiliar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
order. It is a singular costume, but you
soon come to like it, and when the clean,
white headdress is seen in the distance, it
is pleasant to be able to recognize its wearer
as a woman of Bethlehem. As we pass one
little company after another, we cannot
help looking rather closely to see what kind
of women these are who are coming out
from the town of Ruth and of Mary.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Outside of poetical romances, one does
not find many examples of Oriental beauty.
There are multitudes of pretty children,
and the girls of twelve or fourteen have
large, soft eyes, regular features and graceful
figures; but early marriages and the
subsequent drudgery, combined with a lack
of proper dentistry, usually turn them into
toothless, wrinkled hags at an age when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>they should be most attractive. There
are exceptions among the richer classes and
among girls who have been educated in
schools connected with European or American
missions; but on the whole there are very
few fine-looking women over twenty-five
years old to be found in Palestine.</p>

<p>We are therefore surprised to notice that
many of these Bethlehem women are really
handsome; not with the rich, voluptuous
beauty which is usually associated with the
East, but with a matronly dignity which
appeals more strongly to our Western eyes.
We enjoy watching that young mother who
is carrying the baby upon her shoulder; she
is such a straight, slender woman, with
clean-cut features and honest eyes. We like
the old woman beside her; an old woman who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
looks like a grandmother, not like a withered
witch, and who carries herself with a dignity
that wins our admiration.</p>

<p>It may be due to nothing more than good
food and pure water, or to the great headdresses
which make it necessary to stand so
erect; but whatever the cause, it seems to us
that not even in Nazareth have we seen
so many self-respecting, motherly-looking
women as in this town which once witnessed
the apotheosis of motherhood.</p>

<p>As we stroll along the well-paved road, we
pass one spot after another which is not only
connected by tradition with the sacred history,
but which has been noted by such a long
succession of pious pilgrims that even the
most trivial fables seem to bind us more
closely with the innumerable throng which
for nineteen centuries has been treading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
with reverent feet this ancient highway to
the birthplace of our Lord.</p>

<p>Off to our right is the Wâdi el-Werd,
“The Valley of Roses,” which recalls the
quaint tale of Sir John Mandeville. At
the left of the road is a well by which Mary
is said to have rested on her way to Bethlehem,
and in which a few days later the
Wise Men found again the reflection of the
guiding Star. Some distance further on,
near the venerable monastery of St. Elijah,
the “Field of Peas” is still strewn with its
little, rounded stones. A sudden rise in
the road broadens our horizon so that we
can see, off to the left and very far below
us, the dark blue waters of the Dead Sea.
Six or seven miles to the southeast there
rises the striking profile of the Frank
Mountain, shaped like a truncated pyramid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
upon whose platform lie the ruins of
Herod’s famous castle. Glimpses of Bethlehem
itself are caught now and then between
the surrounding heights. We pass
the tomb of beautiful, warm-hearted, impulsive
Rachel, the sadness of whose lonely
burial by the roadside has touched the hearts
of passers-by for nearly forty centuries.</p>

<p>Here we leave the main road, which goes
on southward to Hebron, and turn in to the
left to Bethlehem. “David’s Well” has
long been identified with a series of cisterns
hewn in the rock some distance before
we reach the modern city. Somewhere
in the fields below us Ruth gleaned
among the harvesters of Boaz. Somewhere
among those same fields the youthful
David tended his father’s sheep. Somewhere
above them rang the glad music of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the angelic Gloria. Somewhere on the long
hilltop, now covered by the white, closely-built
houses of the town, the Saviour of the
world was born.</p>

<p>The heart must be dead to romance as
well as to religion, which does not beat with
a strange, solemn excitement upon entering
the Christmas City.</p>

THE HOUSE OF BREAD</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Bethlehem</span> Ephrathah, which was
once “little to be among the thousands
of Judah,” is now one of the largest and
wealthiest Christian towns in all Palestine.</p>

<p>The Hebrews called it <em>Beth Lehem</em>, “the
House of Bread”; and its modern Arabic
name is no less significant—<em>Beit Lahm</em>,
“the House of Meat,” that is, of course,
the Prosperous City. The soil takes on a
greater fertility as Jerusalem is left behind;
but we are hardly prepared for the beautiful
greenness that is seen when a sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
turn in the road brings into view the two
large Christian towns of Beit Jala and
Beit Lahm. One is on an eminence to the
right of the Hebron road; the other is on
an elevation to the left; and they both look
very clean and white and well-to-do, in the
midst of their vineyards and orchards.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image149" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">BETHLEHEM<br>
The massive buildings at the left are all connected with the Church of the Nativity</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Bethlehem, which is the larger of the two,
is built along the summit of a crescent-shaped
hill, about two-thirds of a mile long,
with its concave side toward the north, so
that practically the entire town is spread
out before us as we approach it from Jerusalem.
At the right-hand horn of the crescent
are large, square buildings belonging
to various Latin monastic orders. At the
left are the dark, heavy walls of the Church
of the Nativity, with its low, open belfry.
Between these larger structures is a confused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>mass of closely-built white houses,
whose profile is broken only by the tall,
slender spire of the chapel of the German
Mission. Immediately in front of us the
steep slope of the hill below the town is carefully
terraced, and planted here and there
with small olive and fig orchards.</p>

<p>The town is the market of all the district
around, which is rich in agricultural products.
For many centuries Bethlehem has
also been famous for the manufacture of
souvenirs, which are sold to pilgrims and
tourists, not only here, but in Jerusalem
and Damascus and Beirût. Rosaries, paper-cutters,
cigarette holders and stamp
boxes are made from olive wood, the bituminous
“Moses-stone” from the Dead Sea is
shaped into little vases and paper weights,
and mother-of-pearl is carved into elaborate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
bas-reliefs of sacred scenes. The
shop-keepers are busy and energetic, and a
prosperous self-respect seems characteristic
of everything about the place.</p>

<p>The inhabitants number eight or nine
thousand, nearly all of whom are Christians;
adherents of one or other of the Oriental
Catholic churches. The population seems
to be increasing; for we found some of
the streets almost impassable because of the
piles of stone and lumber for the new buildings.
The modern Bethlehemites have
lived up to the ancient reputation of their
town for fierce and reckless courage; and
until comparatively recent times there were
frequent and sanguinary clashes between
the Christian and Moslem residents. The
latter, however, were completely driven out
of Bethlehem about seventy-five years ago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
and their houses destroyed; and though some
few have returned, the Moslems still number
only three or four per cent of the population.</p>

<p>In Palestine to-day there is much that is
unclean and unhealthy, poor and degrading;
and many sites that should be hallowed by
the most sacred memories have been profaned
by the hands of idolatry and oppression.
Even Bethlehem and Nazareth have
not entirely escaped; yet these two have
somehow kept a peculiar dignity; and, indeed,
it seems fitting that the place where
our Lord was born, and the place where He
made His earthly home, should maintain a
certain pre-eminence among the cities of the
Holy Land.</p>

THE CHURCH WHICH IS A FORT</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Church of St. Mary in Bethlehem
or, as it is more commonly called, the
Church of the Nativity, was built about the
year 330, during the reign of the Emperor
Constantine; and, as we have already seen,
a very ancient tradition ascribes its erection
to the emperor’s mother, St. Helena.
Through all the wars which have raged
over Palestine and during which the city of
Bethlehem has again and again been devastated
and its houses and castles and monasteries
overthrown, the old church alone has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
escaped destruction. It is no wonder that its
preservation has so often been ascribed to
miraculous interventions. Although the
building has been slightly altered and restored
from time to time, its essential features
have not been changed, and there can
be little doubt that this is the oldest church
in the world.</p>

<p>Except for the single low belfry, the
heavy, confused mass looks more like a fort
than a religious edifice. Besides the central
church, there lie practically under the
same roof three large monasteries, belonging
to the Greek Orthodox, Gregorian Armenian,
and Roman Catholic communions.
The collection of buildings is at the extreme
eastern end of the town, so that while
the front faces the public square of Bethlehem,
the rear is at the very edge of a steep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
cliff, below which stretches the open country.
Viewed from the east, the massive pile
resembles a great feudal castle overlooking
the farm lands of the vassals in the valley
beneath.</p>

<p>There are very few windows in the thick
stone walls, and the main entrance from the
square is by a single narrow door, so low
that one must stoop in passing through.
The two other doorways at the front have
been walled up and this one purposely made
so small, for fear of attack by the Moslems.
Yet to-day we find just inside the vestibule a
half-company of Turkish infantry. It seems
strangely incongruous that Moslem soldiers
should be encamped in a Christian church,
but we shall see later that there is a good
reason for their presence here.</p>

Showing the high stone wall which separates the nave from the choir and transepts</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The church proper is only about one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
and twenty feet long and the whole interior
cannot be seen at one view; for, as an
additional protection in case of conflict with
the Moslems, the transepts and choir are
concealed by a high wall built right across
the church, so that from the entrance only
the nave is visible. This is plain to the
point of bareness. Except for a few dimly
burning lamps, the only light comes from
small windows set high up in the wall, just
under the roof. Above the reddish limestone
columns which separate the nave from
the aisles can still be seen the remains of
the famous mosaics given by the Emperor
Comnenos; but these are so badly defaced
that it is often difficult to determine the subject
of the pictures. To the right a small
door leads to the Greek monastery; another
door at the left opens into the buildings belonging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>to the Latin monks. The dividing
wall at the back is pierced by three doors.
Two of these can be entered by no priests
except those of the Greek Orthodox Church,
but the use of the third is shared also with
the Armenian clergy. The Roman Catholic
monks enter the transepts directly from
their adjoining monastery: they have little
to do, however, with the part of the building
which is above ground.</p>

<p>These entrances bring us abruptly from
the impressive simplicity of the nave to the
transepts and choir, which are well lighted
and are almost oppressive in their lavish
ornamentation. The great altar facing us
belongs to the Greeks, and in front of it are
the stalls of the Greek clergy and the tall
patriarchal throne. The smaller altar of
the Armenians is off at one side in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
northern transept. Lamps of gold and
silver swing from the ceiling; bright-colored
pictures hang here and there; tawdry,
tinsel decorations glitter everywhere; and
on the upper part of the walls are portions
of quaint mosaic pictures representing scenes
from the life of Christ. All that we have
yet seen, however, is a mere antechamber to
the holy places which lie in the rock beneath
the church.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SACRED CAVES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">At</span> each side of the central altar of the
Church of the Nativity a narrow
stairway leads down to a series of six underground
chambers, which undoubtedly were
originally natural caverns, although they
have since been somewhat enlarged and the
native rock in many places has been overlaid
with marble slabs. In one of these
caves St. Jerome is said to have lived; in
the next he is buried, near to the tomb of
his friend and pupil, Paula. In other
chambers the monks point out the exact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
spot where the worshipping Magi stood,
the opening in the wall from which a spring
miraculously gushed forth out of the solid
rock for the use of the Holy Family, the
place where the angel appeared to Joseph
and commanded him to go down into Egypt,
and the corner where the soldiers of Herod
massacred a number of children who had
been brought here for refuge.</p>

<p>The largest cave, and the first we enter
from the church above, is about forty feet
long. At one end of it there is let into the
pavement a large silver star with the inscription,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic de Virgine Maria Jesus
Christus natus est</i>, “Here Jesus Christ was
born of the Virgin Mary.”</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image169" style="max-width: 48.4375em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE ALTAR OF THE NATIVITY<br>
In the floor beneath is seen the Silver Star</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>If the inscription is true, there is no other
spot on earth so sacred as this, save only
Calvary and the Garden Tomb. And it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>quite probable that the stable was really in
a cave; for in hilly Judea it often happens
that a house or an inn is built on a slope,
with the living quarters entirely above
ground, but with the stable beneath partly
excavated in the rock. Sometimes, indeed,
there is a natural cavern which, with very
little alteration, can be used for housing the
animals.</p>

<p>Tradition concerning the place of the
Nativity goes back to the very early ages
of Christianity. In the middle of the second
century Justin Martyr states that Christ
was born in a cave. In the third century
Origen says, “There is shown at Bethlehem
the cave where He was born, and the
manger in the cave where He was wrapped
in swaddling clothes. And this site is
greatly talked of in surrounding places,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
even among the enemies of the faith, it being
said that in this cave was born that
Jesus who is worshipped and reverenced by
the Christians.” In the fourth century
Eusebius tells of the building of this very
church by St. Helena, who “dedicated two
churches to the God whom she adored, one
at the grotto which was the scene of the
Saviour’s birth, and the other on the mount
of His ascension. For He who was ‘God
with us’ had submitted to be born even in
a cave of the earth, and the place of His
nativity was called Bethlehem by the Hebrews.”
And from the fourth century on,
there is an unbroken chain of testimony concerning
the identification of this particular
cavern with the scene of the Nativity.</p>

<p>The star is in a little recess at the end of the
cave, and above it is an altar, small but very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
richly furnished. Of the fifteen altar-lamps
of gold and silver which hang around the
star, six belong to the Greek, five to the
Armenian and four to the Latin monks,
who divide in this way the ownership of
most of the shrines in the church. The
floor of the entire cave is of marble, upon
its walls are marbles and rich tapestries,
and many lamps hang from the ceiling; yet,
on coming from the bright transepts above,
the first impression is one of deep gloom.
The low roof can hardly be distinguished,
and the back of the cave is lost in impenetrable
darkness. The smoking lamps give
to the atmosphere a heavy, reddish color.
The chanting of the priests in the choir overhead
is heard only as a dull murmur. We
are the only visitors to-day, except that in
front of the little altar there kneel four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
French nuns, great tears rolling down their
pallid faces as they pray in a frightened
whisper.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE GUARD OF THE SILVER STAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Our</span> eyes are now growing accustomed
to the subdued light, and off in one
corner of the cave where the gloom is very
deep, a form is slowly coming into view.
Dark, indistinct, immovable; it would be
possible for a worshipper to come and go,
and never see that shape at the end of the
altar; but by day and by night it is always
there—the Moslem guardian of the Silver
Star. That is why there is a garrison in
the church above. The soldier is half-fed
and paid not at all, and his blue uniform is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
ragged and dirty; but he holds a modern
repeating rifle in his hand as he stands there
by the hour without moving a muscle, ready
when need comes to face valiantly any odds
in the performance of his duty.</p>

<p>He needs to be brave; for when the Christmas
season comes round, Bethlehem is
thronged with worshippers of the Prince of
Peace. They fill the church to overflowing.
They rush down the narrow stairways
that lead to the little cave, and there
they crowd and curse and fight for a glimpse
of the Silver Star; so that sometimes the
air grows foul and the lamps burn even
more dimly and women faint and strong men
fall down and are trampled to death in the
horrible confusion.</p>

<p>And quiet does not come with the passing
of the Christmastide; but all through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
year the monks from the convents above
quarrel over the possession of the little
shrine, and open warfare is not uncommon.
Then the rival parties snarl and
scratch; they seize heavy lamps and holy
candlesticks from the altars, and priestly
garments are torn and priestly heads are
broken, until soldiers from the Turkish garrison
come down and assist the sentry in
clubbing the unruly ones into submission.</p>

<p>I often wonder what the silent sentinel
thinks about as he stands there hour by
hour, watching the smoky lights that glow
above the Silver Star.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SONG OF THE KNEELING WOMEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> turned in sadness of heart to shake
the dust of Bethlehem from our feet.
Up out of the cave and out of the transept
we hurried; but then we took the wrong
door, and instead of reaching the public
square, we found ourselves in the church of
the Franciscans. It was the time of the vesper
service, and among the shadows of the
unlighted nave there stretched long lines of
kneeling women. They were all natives of
Bethlehem, with the tall white headdress
whose spotless cleanness is in such contrast
to the costumes of most Palestinian villagers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>It was a service of song, and every
woman seemed to be taking part. After the
officiating priest chanted each brief stanza,
the loud chorus was taken up by the full
volume of sweet soprano voices. As the
light died away, and the white-veiled forms
of the kneeling worshippers grew indistinct
and dreamlike, the music of the oft-repeated
chorus sank into our hearts, and we stayed
on and on, until our anger against the sham
and idolatry in the caves below had all been
driven away and there remained only the
Bethlehem calm.</p>

<p>None of us knew the name of that evening
hymn. It was very simple, yet one of
the sweetest melodies we had ever heard.
We shall never forget the song, or the calm
faces of the women who sang it. I have
listened for it since in many cathedrals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
Two years later I went back to the Bethlehem
church in the hope of hearing it again;
but there seemed to be no vespers that evening.
We could not understand the words of
the song; we could not even tell whether it
was in Latin or Arabic, but I like to believe
that it was a hymn about the Babe of
Bethlehem. And now, when I think of that
village among the beautiful hills of far-away
Judea, the bigotry and jealousy do not seem
so very important. I am even ready to forgive
the Moslem guardian of the Silver
Star, for the sake of that nameless melody
of the women of Bethlehem.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Night</span> falls. The stars shine brightly
through the clear Judean air. We
walk very slowly down the winding road,
and often stop to look back to the hilltop
where the thick-clustered houses of the little
town stand so clear and white against
the blue-black sky. Yonder lies Bethlehem,
bathed in soft, silvery starlight which
cleanses it from every trace of violence and
bigotry and crime, and paints only pleasant
memories of love and valor and hope.</p>

<p>There the lonely heart of the Moabitess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
found its haven. There the sweet singer
of Israel set to melodious measures the
story of the fields and the mountains and the
divine Shepherd’s care. There a wondrous
Child was born, for whose sake wise
men and tender women left home and
friends across the sea, that they might dwell
near the hallowed, humble spot of His
Nativity. Within the vague, dark shadow
of that ancient church, the noblest-born of
earth have gathered to do homage to the
Lord of lords and King of kings. And
across the stillness of the night there seem
to echo again the sturdy shouts of dauntless
warriors who made the mountains ring with
their triumphant cry of faith, “God wills it!
God wills it!”</p>

<p>Yes, God has willed it all, even in the
hardest, darkest hour of Bethlehem’s long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
history. Before our lingering steps lie the
noisy bazaars of Jerusalem and the busy,
practical, modern world to which we must
so soon return. But we have been to Bethlehem;
and across all the troublous ages,
bursting from every shining star, and
drowning with its sweet music the perplexities
of our own weary lives, there rings the
glad refrain of the Angel’s Song—</p>
